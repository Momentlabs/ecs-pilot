/*
 * There are elements to the protocol that the UI currently needs
 *
 * REQUEST_CLUSTERS
 * Causes a list of clusters to get loaded into the databse from
 * the server.
 *
 * SELECT_CLUSTER
 * Loads the rest of the data assocaited with the selected cluster.
 * and adds this cluster to the select list.
 *
 * DESELECT_CLUSTER
 * Removes this cluster from the select list. DOES NOT CHANGE ANY OTHER INTERNAL STATE.
 * This means that the state for the deselected server is kept.
 *
 * REQUEST_ALL
 * Requests all data assocaited with the selected clusters (thik of this as updte after a select).
 *
 *
 * The remaining protocol elements are used by sagas to 
 * generate the rest of the calls for the data to come along.
